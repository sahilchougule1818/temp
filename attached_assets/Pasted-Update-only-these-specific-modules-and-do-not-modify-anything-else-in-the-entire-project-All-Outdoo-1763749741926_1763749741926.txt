Update only these specific modules and do not modify anything else in the entire project:
All Outdoor submodules
Indoor → Sampling module only
🔥 CHANGES REQUIRED (APPLY TO ALL OUTDOOR SUBMODULES + INDOOR SAMPLING)
1. Remove the “Filter” Tab
Completely remove the Filter tab from:
Every Outdoor submodule
Indoor → Sampling module
2. Fix the Add Entry (Green Button) Behavior
Currently it opens a dropdown form.
I want the behaviour changed to:
✔ Open a Popup (Modal Window)
When clicking green Add Entry:
Open a modal popup (same style as Indoor module popups).
No dropdown forms.
Popup should contain all data fields required for that submodule.
✔ Add Save Button
Inside the popup:
Add Save button next to Cancel button.
User must be able to Save or Cancel the data entry.
Connect Save button to the existing submit function for that form.
3. Add a Search Button to the Search Panel
In the top search/filter row where Batch Name and Crop Name dropdowns exist:
Add a Search button.
Use the same behaviour already present in Indoor modules.
Search should trigger data fetch based on:
Batch Name
Crop Name
4. Fix UI Layout & Sizing Issues
Outdoor — Search Panels
Make sure dropdowns and the new Search button align properly.
No overlap.
Consistent height & width across all Outdoor submodules.
Indoor → Sampling
The search panel layout is overlapping; fix spacing & alignment.
Make it clean, properly sized, and identical to Outdoor alignment standards.
5. Outdoor → Batch Timeline Fix
In Outdoor modules, the Batch Timeline section has issues:
✔ Show Current Status in Upper Panel
Fix so “Current Status” appears in the top area of the Batch Timeline.
✔ Fix the Layout & Sizing
Align boxes properly
Fix spacing
Make the timeline visually clean without broken layout
6. Add “View All Records” Tab to All Outdoor Modules
Indoor modules already have a working View All Records tab:
Clicking it shows full history (recent + older entries)
Default table view still shows today’s records
✔ Copy this behaviour to all Outdoor submodules
Do NOT change Indoor behaviour
Just add the same tab to all Outdoor modules
🚫 VERY IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS
Do NOT:
Change any backend APIs
Rename any files or components
Modify anything outside:
✔ Outdoor submodules
✔ Indoor → Sampling module only
Touch Indoor modules other than Sampling
Change table structure or existing logic, except where instructed
🎯 WHAT YOU MUST DO
Go through each Outdoor submodule and Indoor → Sampling
Apply all UI changes exactly as described
Add/modify only what is needed
Ensure everything compiles and keeps existing behaviour untouched except where required
