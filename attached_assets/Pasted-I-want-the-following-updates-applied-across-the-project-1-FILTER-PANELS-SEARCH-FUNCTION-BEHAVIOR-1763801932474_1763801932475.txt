I want the following updates applied across the project:
1. FILTER PANELS – SEARCH FUNCTION BEHAVIOR (ALL MODULES BELOW)
Functionality requirements
Each filter panel has 2 dropdowns according to the association rules below
(or 1 dropdown in the specified inventory/supplier modules).
After selecting valid dropdown values and clicking Search:
The register must display only the filtered records
A new button must appear next to the Edit tab named:
“Back to Main Data”
When tapping it → the register restores full data view
Use existing demo data in registers to demonstrate filtering results.
Association rules per module
Indoor:
Media Prep → Crop Name → Media Name → Search
Subculturing → Crop Name → Media Name → Search
Incubation → Crop Name → Media Name → Search
Cleaning Record → Date → Area Cleaned → Search
Sampling → Crop Name → Media Name → Search
Outdoor:
Primary Hardening → Crop Name → Media Name → Search
Secondary Hardening → Crop Name → Media Name → Search
Shifting Register → Crop Name → Media Name → Search
Contamination Register should be renamed to “Mortality”
Mortality → Crop Name → Media Name → Search

2. INVENTORY & SUPPLIER MODULE CHANGES
✅ Inventory Withdrawal Register

Add Record Form Must:

4. GENERAL RULES FOR IMPLEMENTATION
Do not change folder names
Do not remove existing working UI logic except where specified
Ensure all registers refresh properly after returning to full data
