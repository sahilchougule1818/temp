Make search button functional in all modules , when we tap on search button then in below register only searched batch data should be rendered , and then after only searched data is rendered add one button in left side of the edit tab as back to main data after taping on it all the recent data must be visible (ensure this functions as mentioned in all the filter bars present of all the modules)

And the edit form in indoor sampling is not at all correct make it same as edit form in outdoor’s sampling as it is functionality and just remove the action column from indoor sampling register 

In media prep edit tab it is directly popping up edit form ! But it should first pop up the form to select the date and batch code , just like other module’s edit tab having it 
And in indoor modules media preparation submodule’s filter search panel there is no batch name associated in register rather than it is media name so drop down for media code in place of batch name 

In the cleaning record’s search panel there should not be drop downs for batch name and crop name but drop down just for the area cleaned in cleaning record register and machine cleaned drop down in deep cleaning register 


In the Inventory and Sales modules, remove the “View All Records” button and replace it with the existing “Edit Record” button that appears in the top-right corner.

The Inventory Purchase Register must be moved to the Supplier Detail module instead of the Inventory Record module. After relocating it, include a sliding toggle like the one currently used in Inventory Record to switch between the two registers.

Within Supplier Detail, the first register should be the Inventory Purchase Register, and the second should be the Supplier Detail register.

Within Inventory Record, keep only a single register named Inventory Withdraw Register. Its table should include the following columns:
	•	Item Name
	•	Date of Purchase
	•	Quantity When Purchased
	•	Current Quantity
	•	Date of Withdraw

When the user selects an Item Name while adding data, the system should automatically populate the Previous Stock field. The user will then enter the withdrawal quantity, and the updated balance should display in the Current Quantity field.

In the Purchase Register, remove the Current Stock column and replace it with the Supplier Name column. Additionally, add an Export button to all submodules within both Inventory and Supplier sections.
