Update the project with the following UI and functional changes:

1. Subculturings & Incubations
* Update the filter panel to follow this association sequence: Crop Name → Batch Name → Search Button
* Search results must display only the filtered register data.

2. Indoor Modules
* Move Performance Report above Media Preparation.
* Rename Performance Report to Indoor Dashboard.

3. Outdoor Module
* In ALL outdoor submodule registers:
    * Add the same outer border layout used in indoor registers for consistency.

4. Inventory & Supplier Module
Supplier Detail submodule:
* When switching between registers:
    * Purchase Register must appear first, then supplier detail register second.
Edit button placement:
* The Edit button must appear BEFORE the Add Data button.

5. Inventory Record Module
Update the register fields to show in this exact order:
1. Item name
2. Quantity when purchased
3. Current quantity
4. Withdrawn quantity
5. Previous quantity
6. Date of withdraw
Form behavior when adding data:
* Selecting Item Name should auto-fill Previous Stock with current inventory.
* When entering Withdraw Quantity, the Current Stock must auto-update accordingly.

6. Batch Timeline Fixes
* Current stock status indicator is not rendering because custom background className conflicts with default Button variant.
* Explicitly remove variant or use a neutral container so custom colors apply correctly.
* Update layout and sizing of full batch timeline:
    * Fix overlapping elements
    * Print timeline and Export buttons must not overlap
    * Ensure clean alignment and spacing

7. Tunnel Schematic Overview Update
* I will provide an image of the Outdoor Dashboard.
* In our project’s Outdoor Dashboard, there is also a section named Tunnel Schematic Overview.
* Update the Tunnel Schematic Overview so that it looks exactly the same as in the provided image, including:
    * layout
    * UI styling
    * demo data
* Ensure it renders correctly without layout or data binding issues.

General Expectations
* Preserve existing data and component structure
* Do NOT reference ERP1 or ERP2 or rename folders
* Ensure all UI updates render properly
* Maintain responsive and consistent styling across modules
