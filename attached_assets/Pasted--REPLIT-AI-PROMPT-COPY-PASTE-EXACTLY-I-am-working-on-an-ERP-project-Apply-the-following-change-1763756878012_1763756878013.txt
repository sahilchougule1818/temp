✅ REPLIT AI PROMPT — COPY & PASTE EXACTLY
I am working on an ERP project.
Apply the following changes ONLY to:
All Outdoor submodules
All Indoor submodules
Do NOT modify anything else in the project.
🔥 A) REMOVE “View All Records” FROM ALL MODULES
Remove the View All Records button/tab from:
Every Outdoor submodule
Every Indoor submodule
After removing it:
Tables must always show ALL records (not only today’s records)
No filtering by date unless already built-in elsewhere
🔥 B) REMOVE “Actions” COLUMN FROM ALL OUTDOOR TABLES
Remove the Actions tab/column completely from:
All Outdoor module tables
Table should only show data columns (no action buttons inside the table)
🔥 C) ADD NEW “EDIT” TAB (REPLACE View All Records Area)
Where the “View All Records” button used to be, add a new button:
✔ Button name: Edit
✔ Behavior:
When the user taps Edit, the system must open a popup modal, similar to the Add Entry popup.
✔ Inside the Edit popup form:
First field → Date (dropdown)
User selects the date for which they want to edit data
Second field → Batch Code (dropdown)
After selecting a date, this dropdown must show only batch codes available for that date
After selecting the Batch Code:
All the previous saved data for that batch must autofill into the form fields
User can now edit the existing values
🔥 D) BUTTONS INSIDE EDIT POPUP
Inside the Edit popup, there MUST be three buttons:
Save Changes
Updates the existing entry with modified values
Delete Entry
Deletes the selected record
Cancel
Closes the popup without changes
🔥 E) POPUP / FORM BEHAVIOR RULES
Must use the same popup modal style as the existing Indoor popups
Popups must NOT be dropdown forms anymore — they should be actual modal windows
Must work uniformly across:
All Outdoor submodules
All Indoor submodules
🚫 STRICT RESTRICTIONS — DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE
Do NOT modify backend APIs
Do NOT rename files
Do NOT change any logic outside edit/add popup or table display
Do NOT touch modules outside Outdoor + Indoor
Do NOT modify crop, batch, or tunnel logic unrelated to the requested features
🎯 IMPLEMENTATION STEPS (for Replit AI)
Remove “View All Records” everywhere
Make all tables load all records by default
Remove “Actions” column from all Outdoor tables
Add an Edit tab in place of View All Records
Implement edit popup with:
Date → Batch Code → Autofill data
Save Changes, Delete Entry, Cancel
Use same modal UI style as existing Indoor popups
