Make the following changes ONLY in these modules:
Outdoor
All Outdoor submodules
Indoor
Sampling
Media Preparation
Incubation
Cleaning Record
Do NOT modify anything else in the project.
🔥 1. FIX EDIT BUTTON IN MEDIA PREPARATION (INDOOR)
Media Preparation has a different structure:
It does not use Batch Code
It uses Media Code
✔ Required behavior for Edit button (same workflow as other modules):
User clicks Edit
A popup modal opens
First dropdown → Date
Second dropdown → Media Code (instead of batch code)
After selecting Media Code → Autofill the existing saved data inside the form
User can edit and save
🔥 2. ADD 3 BUTTONS IN EVERY EDIT POPUP (ALL MODULES)
Right now edit popups only show Delete and Cancel.
Every Edit popup in all Outdoor and Indoor modules must include:
✔ Save Changes
✔ Delete Entry
✔ Cancel
Buttons must be shown in this order and placed at the bottom of the popup.
🔥 3. FIX EDIT BUTTON POSITION IN INDOOR MODULES
In the following Indoor modules:
Media Preparation
Incubation
Cleaning Record
The Edit button is placed on the top-right, but it must be moved to:
✔ Left side of the Add Record (green button)
Layout example (left → right):
[ Edit ]   [ Add Record ]
Additionally:
Indoor Sampling currently has NO Edit button → add Edit button there with the same popup behavior.
🔥 4. FIX SEARCH BUTTON VISIBILITY IN ALL MODULES
In the top search panel of every register:
Batch Name dropdown
Crop Name dropdown
(sometimes Tunnel, etc.)
Search button (green) — currently invisible in many modules
✔ Make the Search button clearly visible
Must have proper styling
Must appear on the same row as dropdowns
Must not overlap
Must trigger the existing search function
Apply this to all Outdoor modules and all Indoor modules
